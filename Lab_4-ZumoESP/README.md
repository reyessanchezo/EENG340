# Lab-4-reyesanchezo
This folder relates to my Interfacing Lab project, where I developed a carrier board for an ESP32 to mount on top of a Pololu Zumo Robot. The overarching goal is to have a standalone, self-contained device, integrated with the Zumo robot, and adds the ESP's features to the Zumo (including USB-C, WiFi, Bluetooth, and wireless programming)

ESP-WIFI contains the files that ran on the ESP32 to provide I2C communication.
Lab4-2.pdf is the handout that guided the project.
