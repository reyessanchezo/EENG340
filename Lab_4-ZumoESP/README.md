# Lab-4-reyesanchezo
This folder relates to my Interfacing Lab project, where I developed a carrier board for an ESP32 to mount on top of a Pololu Zumo Robot. The overarching goal is to have a standalone device that is self contained, integrated with the Zumo robot, and adds the ESP's features to the Zumo (including usb-c, wifi, bluetooth, and wireless programming)
