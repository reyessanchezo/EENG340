{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Lab 4 Open-Ended Project\n","This lab is about modernizing the Zumo 32U4 from Pololu. The overarching goal is to implement wireless programming of the Zumo bot using an ESP32-S3 on a carrier board atop the Zumo. Another goal of this project is to gain practice developing a PCB, though it is not required for the functionality. The Zumo bot is a small arduino-based robot with built-in sensors such as proximity, line-following, and an imu. This project will prepare the zumo for the next project, where we will implement closed-loop feedback for moving the Zumo bot. For this project, the minimum goal is to have the Zumo bot moving freely with the ESP32-S3 sitting on top.  "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Preparation\n","In order to interface with the Zumo bot, the ESP32 can use the I2C bus. The I2C bus on the Zumo bot's expansion headers runs at 5V logic, while the ESP32 runs on 3.3V logic. The goal is to connect the ESP32 as a controller on the I2C bus and treat the Zumo and sensors as peripherals. To start working with the Zumo bot, headers needed to be attached to the peripheral connections on the 32U4 board. Following the [Zumo schematic](Media\\zumo-32u4-schematic-diagram.pdf) and [Zumo pinout diagram](Media/zumo-32u4-pinout.pdf), I found that I needed to solder headers on the right expansion area to access 5V, Ground, SDA, and SCL. This took removing the batteries and solder the headers on from underneath the board. \n","\n","Before being able to connect the ESP32-S3 to the Zumo's SDA and SCL, there needs to be a level shifter in between to shift the ESP's 3.3V logic to the Zumo's 5V. I used a SparkFun Level Shifter to do this. Later on, I include level shifters into the PCB design to minimize external parts. \n","\n","Once the headers were on the Zumo, I connected the ESP to the level shifter, Zumo power, and from the level shifter to the Zumo.\n","\n","![Zumo connected to ESP on a breadboard](Media/ZumoESPBreadboard.png)\n","\n","With the ESP connected, I then developed the [ESP I2C Controller Code](ESPControl/ESPControl.ino). This program defines a custom I2C communication protocol that sends commands to the Zumo robot. The program reads commands from the serial monitor on a connected computer, in the format: command, parameter input. The command \"1,10\" will make the Zumo robot move forward 10 inches, while \"3,90\" will turn the robot 90 degrees to the right. [This demo](Media/ZumoESPBreadboard.png) shows Zumo resonded to test commands from the ESP32.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Appendix: Code\n","# ESP I2C controller "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["    #include<Wire.h>\n","\n","    byte command = 0;\n","    int decimal = 0;\n","    int value = 0;\n","\n","    #define FORWARD 1\n","    #define REVERSE 2\n","    #define RIGHT 3\n","    #define LEFT 4\n","\n","    void SendToZumo(byte cmd, double argument);\n","    void updateI2C();\n","\n","    void setup()\n","    {\n","      Serial.begin(9600);\n","      Wire.setPins(13, 14); // pick whichever pins you like. //setPins(data,clock)\n","      Wire.begin();\n","\n","      Wire.beginTransmission(0x21); //roll calling for the Slave\n","      byte busStatus = Wire.endTransmission();\n","      if (busStatus != 0x00)\n","      {\n","        while (busStatus != 0x00){\n","          Wire.beginTransmission(0x21); //roll calling for the Slave\n","          busStatus = Wire.endTransmission();\n","          delay(1000); \n","          Serial.println(\"I2C Bus communication problem...!
