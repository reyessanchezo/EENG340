    "This lab is about motors. The goal is to learn to interface various motors with the PSoC microcontroller. The motors are a microservo, 5V stepper motor, 12V DC motor, and a higher power DC motor that is rated for up to 36V. The design considerations for each include PWM control for the servo, frequency control for the stepper, \n"

    "The first motor implemented is the PWM-controlled microservo. I used the PSoC ADC to implement the joystick from the last lab here. The joystick is read and used to control the compare value in a PWM component to vary the pulse width from 1 to 2 milliseconds. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is intended to correspond to 0-180 degrees of rotation on the servo, though the servo is cheap and this resulted in a strange range of motion. After adjusting the scaling and offset values of the ADC readings, I was able to get the range closer to 0-180 degrees. The physical deadzone on the joystick also meant that the servo would not start moving until the joystick was moved past a certain point in either direction. After adjustments, the pulse width ranged from 0.75ms to 2.65ms. These values achieved a 180 degree range of motion.\n",

    "# Controlling the stepper motor\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the EasyDriver from sparkfun, the PSoC only needs to send step and direction signals to control the motor. \n",
    "The direction signal is simpler and is 1 or 0 to indicate the direction for the motor to spin. The actual direction depends on how the motor is connected to the driver board. \n",
    "The step signal is a pulse signal that tells the driver to step the motor once. The delay between pulses controls the speed that the motor turns.\n",
    "I want to control the stepper motor with the joystick's vertical axis, so I need to determine how the changing ADC values should correspond to the direction and speed. The higher absolute values should correspond to a higher speed. Positive and negative from the neutral position will decide the direction the motor turns\n",
    "\n",
    "To control the speed of the motor, I decided to use a PWM module and use the APIs to change the clock divider value going into the pwm. I use the PWM component to generate the pulse signal the stepper needs, but do not modulate the pulse-width. I change the delay between pulses by changing the divider on the clock input. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reading of the vertical axis on the joystick is used to divide the clock divider value, which results in a range of values from 0 to 100. The direction is controlled simply by the sign of the ADC reading and used to update the direction pin's logic value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Stepper speed:\n",
    "From the [data sheet](Datasheets/ST-PM35-15-11C.pdf), the stepper motor has a stride angle of 7.5Â°, meaning there are 360/7.5 = 48 steps per revolution. My program runs the pulses at up to 2KHz which should correspond to 2000/48 or about 42.7 revolutions per second. In reality, I measured approximately 5.5 revolutions per second. On another run, I got 5.25 rev/sec. Based on this, the steps per revolution actually comes out to between 360 and 380. (2000 steps/sec / 5.5 rev/sec). This suggests that the driver is microstepping the motor at about 1/8 speed. This is, after reviewing the hookup guide for the SparkFun EasyDriver, the default configuration for the driver without modifying the MS1 and MS2 pins. \n",

    "Using the SparkFun TB6612FNG, a full H-Bridge motor driver, the goal here is to control the speed of a DC motor with PWM and use logic to control the direction. Another goal is to measure the output speed of the motor, which can be accomplished using a Hall Effect sensor and mounted magnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "To control the speed of the motor, the joystick position is read using the PSoC's ADC. The absolute value of the ADC reading is scaled to -20k to 20k and used to set the compare value of the PWM, which in turn sets the duty cycle of the motor. The direction is obtained from the sign of the scaled reading and used to set the H-Bridge pins on the motor driver. When the value is near 0 (the joystick is neutral), the driver is set to brake. \n",
    "\n",
    "To measure the speed of the motor, a hall effect sensor is attached to the motor so it can detect a magnet attached to the output shaft of the motor. The hall effect sensor uses an open collector, so it needs to be pulled up to logic voltage before connecting it to the oscilloscope. On the oscilloscope, the frequency outputted by the hall effect sensor can be multiplied to convert to revolutions per minute of the motor's output shaft. At 100% duty cycle, the motor turns at approximately 180 rpm. \n",

    " \n",
    "The large DC motor runs on 36V power. This portion will use two LT1160 half-bridge MOSFET Drivers to drive the motor in a full H-bridge configuration. Analog Devices provides an example schematic showing an implementation of the drivers in a half-bridge configuration. I opened this in LTSpice and modified the schematic to create the full-bridge configuration below. \n",

    "\n",
    "Issues:\n",
    "With the whole system running at 12V, turning the connected motor in one direction would bring it to full speed for a moment before the drivers shut down until the motor stops. Turning the motor in the other direction, the system would be able to sustain its full speed continously.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Turning the motor in either direction creates significant heat in the LT1160 drivers. When turning the motor in the same direction that cuts out, the driver with the top gate active heats up very rapidly. While testing, one of the 1160 drivers seems to have been damaged by the heat and drew much more current than expected. Replacing the driver appeared to fix the problem.\n"

    "# Design Judgments\n",
    "In my program, the joystick controls both the servo and the stepper motor. This reduces the economic impact of the design in two ways: by using a potentiometer joystick instead of the I2C joystick and by combining the control for both motors through each axis of the joystick movement. This means the design uses fewer parts for controlling the motors. The power requirements are also simplified as the entire system can run on a single power supply. "
