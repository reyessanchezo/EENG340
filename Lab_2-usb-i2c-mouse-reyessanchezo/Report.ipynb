    "This lab is about developing a USB Mouse for PSOC-5 using a potentiometer joystick and an i2C joystick from SparkFun. The purpose of this lab is to introduce interfacing a device over USB with a desktop or laptop. One joystick is purely a potentiometer joystick that needs can be used by reading the voltage output with an ADC. The other joystick pre-processes the joystick information using an onboard ATtiny and sends the data over I2C to a connected device. "

    "UART would not connect.                         Solution: remade project after installing KIT for Psoc 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Not showing up on COM port.                     Solution: Hard reset the board by holding the reset switch at least 5 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "ADC values were not displaying.                 Solution: sprintf on the psoc does not display floats properly. Typecast the value to int\n",
    " \n",
    "No x or y data being put in mouse data array.   Solution: Used double temp variable to calculate value then put that in mouse array\n",
    "\n",
    "Tweaking values for usability. Normalized the adc output to between -40 and 40, which was too high for usable cursor movement. Lowered it incrementally until I settled on -10 to 10. \n",
    "The joystick did not need a software deadzone as the physical deadzone was plenty. \n",
    "\n",
    "The raw ADC output is 7 bits unsigned. To normalize it, divide by 2^7 = 128 then multiply by the max value desired. In my case, I used 10. To center the data on 0 when the joystick was neutral, subtracted 10. \n",

    "Mouse circuit\n",

    "The potentiometer mouse only used the ADC channels and power to read the joystick position, shown in the PSoC Creator schematic ![here](Images\\PSoCPOTSchematic.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The I2C was connected through a level shifter for 5V to 3.3V signal shifting. In PSoC Creator, the I2C module is connected to SDA and SCL pins and reads the data from the I2C bus. Schematic: ![here](Images\\PSoCI2CSchematic.png). \n",
    "\n",
    "The I2C protocol built into the joystick sends bytes of data at a time, corresponding to different data points. the 8th byte of data corresponds to the value of the pushbutton on the joystick, for example. In the main.c for the project, the PSoC reads data from the I2C bus and interprets it before sending the data over USB to the connected device (computer). It also reads ADC data from the potentiometer joystick\n",
